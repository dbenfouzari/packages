# :space_invader: React Native Template dbenfouzari

> Clean and minimalist React Native template for a quick start with TypeScript.

## :star: Features

- Elegant usage directly within the [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- Consistent with the default React Native template

## Installation

Since dbenfouzari packages are Github private's packages, you will want to edit your `~/.npmrc` with

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN
@dbenfouzari:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

That way, the command below will work without any problem

## :arrow_forward: Usage

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template @dbenfouzari/react-native-template-dbenfouzari
```

## What's included ?

It has many cool things included :

- @dbenfouzari/eslint-config-react-native
- @dbenfouzari/cli-tools
- Storybook
- react-native-config
- react-native-navigation
- @testing-library/react-native

I'm open to make it grow and get better ! So make me issues and PRs :)
